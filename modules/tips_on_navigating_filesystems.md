# tips for navigating filesystems

![https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html)

it might be worthwhile to use ```os``` for our library (for simplicity)

the way we would do that is this:

``` python
import os
os.path.command()
```

where ```command``` is the command we want to run

another option is this:

``` python
from path import os
path.command()
```

personally, I would use the second way :)
